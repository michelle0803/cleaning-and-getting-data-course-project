Getting and Cleaning Data README file
================

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains the following files:

README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created. tidy\_data.txt, which contains the data set. CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data). run\_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set.

Criteria
--------

1.  The submitted data set is tidy.

2.  The Github repo contains the required scripts.

3.  GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

4.  The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

5.  The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
