Getting and Cleaning Data Code Book
================

Description
-----------

This project objective is to demostrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. A tidy data set will be created for later analysis. The following sections are outlined in this code book:

Data - description of the data set.

Variables - the variables of the data set.

Data transformations - criteria for creating tidy dataset

Data
----

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Variables
---------

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

fBodyGyro-XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from the abobe signals are:

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

mad(): Median absolute deviation

max(): Largest value in array

min(): Smallest value in array

sma(): Signal magnitude area

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.

iqr(): Interquartile range

entropy(): Signal entropy

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Activity Labels
---------------

1 WALKING - subject walking during test

2 WALKING\_UPSTAIRS - subject was walking upstairs during

3 WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING

Data Transformations
--------------------

Created a R script called run\_analysis.R that does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
